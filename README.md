# Luawiki
My favorite parts of [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) + other stuff I come up with


As of 2024-09-06 I no longer use Vimwiki. It was a great ride

Considering:
- [ ] qol shortcuts like `<leader>day` to print a formatted date under the cursor.
- [ ] pandoc & friends
- [ ] per-filetype abstractions
